### Hi there 👋

I am Ege Korkan, an IoT architect at Siemens Munich and an expert in the Web of Things (WoT). I also participate in the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](w3.org) where I am responsible for the outreach of Web of Things and specification documents such as the [Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-wot-thing-description11-20231205/).
Additionally, I am active in the open source with multiple projects such as [Eclipse Thingweb](https://thingweb.io/), [Eclipse EdiTDor](https://eclipse.github.io/editdor/) and [the Thing Model Catalog](https://github.com/wot-oss/tmc).
